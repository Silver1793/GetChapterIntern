What You Need
For the FrontEnd
* Install React.js
   * Go to this link and install NPM for the device you have https://nodejs.org/en/
   * Create a directory and cd into that directory, this will be where your frontend is stored
   * Open Terminal
      * Type npm init
      * Type npm install --save react
      * Type npm install --save react-dom
Now You Should Have React Installed For Your FrontEnd


For the BackEnd
* Install Express.js
   * Go to this link and install NPM for the device you have https://nodejs.org/en/(Assuming it is not already installed)
   * Create a directory and cd into that directory, this will be where your backend is stored
   * Open Terminal
      * Type npm init
      * Type npm install express --save


Modules needed (FrontEnd)
* Install Axios
   * Go into your directory where you have your frontend
   * Type npm install axios


Modules needed(BackEnd)
* Install File System
   * Go into your directory where you have your backend
   * Type npm install file-system --save
You should hopefully have all of the components necessary to run the application
When running the backend type node app.js
When running the frontend type npm start
